Depending on your printer's calibration, you might not be able to get a good fit right away. So print at your own risk, and know your machine !
## Printing your Umō

If you want to get it right the first time, it is recommended to first print out ```test-fit piece.stl``` file found in ```STLs/Other parts/``` folder to test out
your fitment before committing to a full case print. The internal dimensions are sized exactly as the case itself, so if your PCB & plate fit right into the space inside the test piece, you should be good.

Plate STLs are included as well and they do work when 3D-printed, however you might get a better fitment & typing experience by sourcing a laser-cut POM/Acrylic plate or a FR4 1.6mm plate.

The case uses M2 heat inserts, that are melted into the their holes in the top piece. The plate and the bottom will then be installed into the top piece and fastened in place by M2 screws.
There are a few variations for you to print, so pick out the ones that you like, it's your case !
### Hardware & Parts list

1x Top (any variation)
